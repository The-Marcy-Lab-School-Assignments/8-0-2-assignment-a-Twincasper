# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer
Environment variables are hidden variables that are set outside of the application code and stored in an .env file. These variables are stored as key-value pairs on the process.env object, so we can access them in Node by using dot or bracket notation such as `process.env.API_KEY`.
