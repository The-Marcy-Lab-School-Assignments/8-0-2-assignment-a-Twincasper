# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
API requests from the front-end utilizing API keys are dangerous because the front-end of a website or app can be easily inspected, therefore exposing the api key and allowing anyone to make unauthorized requests on it and potentially causing a rate limit or costing the developer money if they are paying based on the amount of requests.
